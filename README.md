# 3D kinematics of mudskippers during terrestrial locomotion

### About
This repo contains the data files, computer code, and results to compare the 3D kinematics between African mudskippers (_Periophthalmus barbarus_) and tiger salamanders (_Ambystoma tigrinum_) during terrestrial locomotion. 

### Contents
- raw xy coordinates from digitizing videos in DLTdv8 in MATLAB
- R code to compare the kinematic data
- Figures of kinematic profiles that were generated in R

### Source 
Videos were collected at Clemson University between 2010 - 2014 in partial fulfillment of a Ph.D. for Sandy Kawano while under the supervision of Rick Blob. 

### Metadata
1. Videos were originally digitized by SMK in 2014 using DLTdv5
2. Digitized points were then checked and corrected by ZQ in 2021

### Collaborators
1. Zach Quigley (The George Washington University)
2. Rick Blob (Clemson University)
3. Sandy Kawano (The George Washington University)
